# Summer school 2025

The links below will open notebooks in Google Colab:

1. [Getting started](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CardiacModelling/summer-school-2025/blob/main/Myokit_installation_and_example_simulation.ipynb)
2. [Hands-on session 1: ion channel models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CardiacModelling/summer-school-2025/blob/main/IonChannelModelling.ipynb)
3. [Hands-on session 2: action potential models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CardiacModelling/summer-school-2025/blob/main/Hands_on_session_2_action_potential_models.ipynb)

These notebooks contain mistakes and errors when you try to run the code - this is intentional! The little tasks denoted where you see a pencil ( :pencil2: ) will tell you what you need to do to get things running properly. 

You can later check the `answers` folder for the reference solutions.
